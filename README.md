### Benjamin Frost Individual Project 2022

#### MSc Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains the code to accompany the written section of dissertation.

The Notebooks/ directory contains the notebooks and helper classes created throughout the project. 

The processingCache/ contains data at different stages of processing, as well as outputs of training models on different dates.

The only cached data file that has been ommitted is the Sepsis dataset which is too large to be included in the repository (440MB).
This file can be computed through execution of the Sepsis.ipynb notebook.

If you intend to train a model using the categorised data in this notebook, the final data files can be found in the categorisedData/ directory.

Thank you,
Ben
